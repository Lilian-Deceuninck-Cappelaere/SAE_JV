The first part of your adventure has been completed…
You visited every IUT’s rooms expected Mr. Synave’s office. 
You got some keys. One of them might open this room’s door.

You have enough items to restore the tutorial room. You’re using cables, computers, computer equipment and furniture from your stocks. 
Only a few of each item remains in your stock. You will have to recuperate stuff in some abandoned store. You also must ask your friends from GEII to rebuild the out of service computers. 
You decide to cross the desolated city to go to an abandoned hardware store. The entrance was booby-trapped. You realized it before getting trapped. While disengaging it you get slightly hurt and you lose 2 HP. You get all the materials and some cooper cables.
